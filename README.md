## Face Detection Using OpenCV

This project implements the simple Face Detection Problem using OpenCV in Python using Haar Cascade Classifiers. The system detects faces in images by using pre-trained Haar Classifier models for frontal, profile and alternate face detection.

## Key Features

Haar Cascade Classifier is used as a pretained model for frontal, profile and alternate face detection.
The system also detects faces with goggles on.
Even program detects fine in a group photos with some little errors.
More accurate face detection could be achieved using advanced DNN models.

Haarcascade classifier can be downloaded from here [OpenCV repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).

The program works well, some errors are observed. This errors could be improved by using more advanced deep learning (DNN) models.

## Examples

Most of the images are downloaded from internet alone with some of mine.

Some of the faces are not detected due to overlapping and requires more advanced models for more accurate detection like DNN models.
